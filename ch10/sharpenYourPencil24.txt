SHARPEN YOUR PENCIL

You know that the comparison function we pass to sort needs to return a number greater than 0, equal to 0, or 
less than 0 depending on the two items we're comparing: if the first item is greater than second, we return a 
value greater than 0; if first item is equal to the second, we return 0; and if the first item is less than 
the second, we return a value less than 0.

Can you use this knowledge with the fact that we're comparing two numbers in compareNumbers to rewrite 
compareNumbers using much less code?

Check your answer at the end of the capter before you go on.

function compareNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 - num2;
}
