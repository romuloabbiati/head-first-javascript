var price = 28.99; -> create a variable named price, and assign the value 28.99 to it

var discount = 10; -> create a variable named discount and assign the value 10 to it

var total = price - (price * (discount / 100)); -> create a variable named total and assign the result of 26.09

if (total > 25) { freeShipping(); } -> if the total is greater than 25, it will execute the function freeShipping()

var count = 10; -> creates a variable named count and assign the value 10 to it

while (count > 0) { 
  juggle();
  count = count - 1;
} -> while the value of count is greater than 10, the while loop will execute the juggle() and decrease the value 
count by 1 each and every iteration. When the value of count becomes 0, the while loop will stop.

var dog = { name: "Rover", weight: 35 }; -> create a variable named dog and assign the object with name "Rover" and 
weight of 35

if (dog.weight > 30) {
  alert("WOOF WOOF");
} else {
  alert("woof woof");
} -> if the object's weight assign to dog is greater than 30, it will pop up an alert box showing the message WOOF 
WOOF, otherwise it will show woof woof

var circleRadius = 20; -> creates a variable named circleRadius and assign the value 20 to it

var circleArea = Math.PI * (circleRadius * circleRadius); -> creates a variable named circleArea and assign the 
result of 1256 to it
