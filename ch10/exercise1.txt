EXERCISE
Let's do a little pre-work on this by first writing a function that takes a passenger as an argument and 
checks to see if that passenger's name is on the no-fly-list. Return true if it is and false otherwise.
Write another function that takes a passenger and checks to see if the passenger hasn't  paid. Return true if 
the passenger has not paid, and false otherwise. We've started the code for you below; you just need to 
finish it. You'll find our solution on the next page, but don't peek!
HINT: assume your no-fly list consists of one individual: Dr. Evel.

function checkNoFlyList(passenger) {
  if (passenger.name === "Dr. Evel") {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}

function checkNotPaid(passenger) {
  if(!passenger.paid) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
