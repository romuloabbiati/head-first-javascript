      // CLOSURE, noun: A closure is a functino together with a referencing environment.
      // A closure results when we combine a function that has free variables with an environment 
      // that provides variable bindings for all those free variables.

      // var count = 0;

      // function counter() {
      //   count = count + 1;
      //   return count;
      // }

      // console.log(counter());
      // console.log(counter());
      // console.log(counter());

      // the problem with the code above is that if this is a big project and I'm working with other people, we tend to use the same variable names. 
      // I had to use a global variable count and someone else could have the same idea to use the same name for a variables that is used to count 
      // something. One way to not define globally is to define that variable count within a function.

      function makeCounter() {
        var count = 0;

        function counter() {
          count = count + 1;
          return count;
        }

        return counter;
      }

      var doCount = makeCounter();
      console.log(doCount());
      console.log(doCount());
