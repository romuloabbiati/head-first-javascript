WHO DOES WHAT?
You've already seen that the event object (for DOM events) has properties that give you more information 
about the event that just happened. Below you'll find other properties that the vent object can have. Match 
each event object property to what it does.

TARGET -> I hold the object on which the event occurred. I can be differente kinds of objects, but most often 
I'm an element object.

TYPE -> I'm a string, like "click" or "load", that tells you what just happened.

TIMESTAMP -> Want to know when your event happened? I'm the property for you.

KEYCODE -> I'll tell you what key the user just pressed.

CLIENTX -> Want to know how far from the left side of the browser window the user clicked? Use me.

CLIENTY -> Want to know how far from the top of the browser window the user clicked? Use me.

TOUCHES -> Uinsg a touch device? Then use me to find out how many fingers are tuoching the screen.
