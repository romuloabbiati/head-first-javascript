alert -> I'll stop your user in his tracks and deliver a short mesage. The user has to click 
on "ok" to go further.

document.write -> I can insert a little HTML and text into a document. I'm not the most elegant 
way to get a message to your users, but I work on every browser.

console.log -> I'm just here for simple debugging purposes. Use me and I can write out information 
to a special developer's console.

document object model -> Using me you can totally control a web page: get values that a user typed in, 
alter the HTML or the syle, or update the content of your page.
