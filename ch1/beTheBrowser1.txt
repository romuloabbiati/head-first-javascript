A - Test for jokes

var jokes = "JavaScript walked into a bar...'; -> it should use either " or ' both not both 
var toldJoke = "false"; -> booleans don't use double quotes on the sides
var $punchline = "Better watch out for those semi-colons." -> semi-colon at the end missing
var %entage = 20; -> it should not start with %
var result -> when you just declare a variable, you need to finish with semi-colon

if (toldJoke == true) {
  Alert($punchline); -> alert starting with capital A
} else -> opening curly braces missing
  alert(joke); -> correct
}

B - Movie Night
var zip code = 98104; -> whitespace within variable name is not allowed
var joe'sFavoriteMovie = Forbidden Planet; -> cannot use ' in a variable name. " missing around forbidden 
planet
var movieTicket$ = 9; -> ending with $ not a good practice, a lot of whitespaces
if (movieTicket$ >= 9) {
  alert("Too much!");
} else {
  alert("We're going to see " + joe'sFavoriteMovie);
}
